# RealmToDo

## Project Setup

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
2. Open project directory in terminal and run `pod install` command
3. Open Workspace of project `*.xcworkspace`

## Example Steps

This is a small application I did for the CocoaHeads in Hamburg on how to integrate Realm in a small project.

You can follow the steps I made with the git tags:

### v1

* Empty application with a simple UITableViewController

### v2

* Add a simple list that is backed by an array

### v3

* Add an ViewController that has an UITextField to enter a new item

### v4

* Add realm instead of the static array

### v5

* Add the ability to add a strikethrough to a finished item

### v6

* Add another section for the UITableView to display finished and unfinished items
